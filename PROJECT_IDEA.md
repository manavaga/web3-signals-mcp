# Web3 Signals x402 — Project Idea

## The Core Idea
A curated crypto signal/narrative API where both humans AND AI agents pay per query using the x402 protocol.

> "Not raw data — interpreted alpha"

---

## The Gap We're Filling
- Everyone in x402 is building generic data APIs and developer tools
- Nobody has built a curated, opinionated, narrative-driven signal feed
- Crypto signals + narratives as a pay-per-query x402 API is completely untouched

---

## Two Layers

### Layer 1: Human Facing
- User visits the site
- Types a question: "What's the narrative around Solana this week?"
- Pays $0.25 USDC via x402
- Gets curated signal + narrative summary instantly

### Layer 2: Agent Facing (the x402 magic)
- Someone else's AI trading agent calls our API automatically
- Pays $0.10 USDC per call via x402
- Gets structured signal data to feed into their strategy
- We earn while sleeping

## Why This Wins a Hackathon

| What judges look for | Our project |
|---------------------|-------------|
| x402 actually working | ✅ Real payments demo-able live |
| Real use case | ✅ Crypto signals are genuinely valuable |
| Agent-to-agent potential | ✅ Other agents can call our API |
| Original angle | ✅ Nobody doing curated narrative signals |
| Live demo | ✅ Show money moving in 30 seconds |

## What We Are NOT Building (Keep Simple)
- No complex newsletter integration yet
- No Twitter scraping (yet)
- No DeFi dashboard
- No user accounts or subscriptions
- No database complexity

**One thing, done well, beats ten things half-built.**

## Month Plan

| Week | Goal |

| Week 1 | Get x402 working with test USDC payments |
| Week 2 | Build the signal/narrative agent behind it |
| Week 3 | Connect payment → answer flow end to end |
| Week 4 | Polish UI + practice demo |
