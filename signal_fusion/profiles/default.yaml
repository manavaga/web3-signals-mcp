# Dynamic reweighting — adjust whale weight based on data availability
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When whale data is missing for an asset, the 30% whale weight gets
# redistributed proportionally to the other 4 dimensions.
# This prevents fake 50.0 neutral scores from dragging composite scores.
#
# Tiers:
#   full   — real whale moves (accumulate/sell detected) → full whale weight
#   sparse — only transfers or exchange flow, no directional moves → half weight
#   none   — no whale data at all → zero weight, fully redistributed

  # Multiplier applied to whale weight for each tier

    none: 0.0          # zero weight (redistributed to other dimensions)

# Conviction multiplier — amplify composite when dimensions agree
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When N+ dimensions independently agree on a direction, boost the composite
# score away from 50. This breaks the "everything is neutral" clustering
# problem and generates more actionable signals.
#
# Example: composite=56, 3 dimensions bullish → 56 + (56-50)*0.25 = 57.5
# Example: composite=42, 3 dimensions bearish → 42 - (50-42)*0.25 = 40.0
